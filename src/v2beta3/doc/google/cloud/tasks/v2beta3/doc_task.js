/**
 * A unit of scheduled work.
 *
 * @property {string} name
 *   Optionally caller-specified in CreateTask.
 *
 *   The task name.
 *
 *   The task name must have the following format:
 *   `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID/queues/QUEUE_ID/tasks/TASK_ID`
 *
 *   * `PROJECT_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]),
 *      hyphens (-), colons (:), or periods (.).
 *      For more information, see
 *      [Identifying projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects)
 *   * `LOCATION_ID` is the canonical ID for the task's location.
 *      The list of available locations can be obtained by calling
 *      ListLocations.
 *      For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/about/locations/.
 *   * `QUEUE_ID` can contain letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]), or
 *     hyphens (-). The maximum length is 100 characters.
 *   * `TASK_ID` can contain only letters ([A-Za-z]), numbers ([0-9]),
 *     hyphens (-), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 500 characters.
 *
 * @property {Object} appEngineHttpRequest
 *   App Engine HTTP request that is sent to the task's target. Can
 *   be set only if
 *   app_engine_http_queue is set
 *   on the queue.
 *
 *   An App Engine task is a task that has AppEngineHttpRequest set.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [AppEngineHttpRequest]{@link google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.AppEngineHttpRequest}
 *
 * @property {Object} scheduleTime
 *   The time when the task is scheduled to be attempted.
 *
 *   For App Engine queues, this is when the task will be attempted or retried.
 *
 *   `schedule_time` will be truncated to the nearest microsecond.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link google.protobuf.Timestamp}
 *
 * @property {Object} createTime
 *   Output only. The time that the task was created.
 *
 *   `create_time` will be truncated to the nearest second.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Timestamp]{@link google.protobuf.Timestamp}
 *
 * @property {number} dispatchCount
 *   Output only. The number of attempts dispatched.
 *
 *   This count includes tasks which have been dispatched but haven't
 *   received a response.
 *
 * @property {number} responseCount
 *   Output only. The number of attempts which have received a response.
 *
 * @property {Object} firstAttempt
 *   Output only. The status of the task's first attempt.
 *
 *   Only dispatch_time will be set.
 *   The other Attempt information is not retained by Cloud Tasks.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Attempt]{@link google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Attempt}
 *
 * @property {Object} lastAttempt
 *   Output only. The status of the task's last attempt.
 *
 *   This object should have the same structure as [Attempt]{@link google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Attempt}
 *
 * @property {number} view
 *   Output only. The view specifies which subset of the Task has
 *   been returned.
 *
 *   The number should be among the values of [View]{@link google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.View}
 *
 * @typedef Task
 * @memberof google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3
 * @see [google.cloud.tasks.v2beta3.Task definition in proto format]{@link https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/cloud/tasks/v2beta3/task.proto}
