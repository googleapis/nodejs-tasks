 * @property {string} parent

 *   The location name.
 *   For example: `projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION_ID`

 * @property {string} filter
 *   `filter` can be used to specify a subset of queues. Any Queue
 *   field can be used as a filter and several operators as supported.
 *   For example: `<=, <, >=, >, !=, =, :`. The filter syntax is the same as
 *   described in
 *   [Stackdriver's Advanced Logs Filters](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/advanced_filters).
 *
 *   Sample filter "app_engine_http_target: *".
 *
 *   Note that using filters might cause fewer queues than the
 *   requested_page size to be returned.
 *
 * @property {number} pageSize
 *   Requested page size.
 *
 *   The maximum page size is 9800. If unspecified, the page size will
 *   be the maximum. Fewer queues than requested might be returned,
 *   even if more queues exist; use the
 *   next_page_token in the
 *   response to determine if more queues exist.
 *
 * @property {string} pageToken
 *   A token identifying the page of results to return.

 *
 *   If schedule_time is not set or is in the

 *
 *   Task De-duplication:
 *
 *   Explicitly specifying a task ID enables task de-duplication.  If
 *   a task's ID is identical to that of an existing task or a task
 *   that was deleted or completed recently then the call will fail
 *   with ALREADY_EXISTS.
 *   If the task's queue was created using Cloud Tasks, then another task with
 *   the same name can't be created for ~1hour after the original task was
 *   deleted or completed. If the task's queue was created using queue.yaml or
 *   queue.xml, then another task with the same name can't be created
 *   for ~9days after the original task was deleted or completed.
 *
 *   Because there is an extra lookup cost to identify duplicate task
 *   names, these CreateTask calls have significantly
 *   increased latency. Using hashed strings for the task id or for
 *   the prefix of the task id is recommended. Choosing task ids that
 *   are sequential or have sequential prefixes, for example using a
 *   timestamp, causes an increase in latency and error rates in all
 *   task commands. The infrastructure relies on an approximately
 *   uniform distribution of task ids to store and serve tasks

 * @property {string} filter
 *   `filter` can be used to specify a subset of tasks to lease.
 *
 *   When `filter` is set to `tag=<my-tag>` then the
 *   response will contain only tasks whose
 *   tag is equal to `<my-tag>`. `<my-tag>` must be
 *   less than 500 characters.
 *
 *   When `filter` is set to `tag_function=oldest_tag()`, only tasks which have
 *   the same tag as the task with the oldest
 *   schedule_time will be returned.
 *
 *   Grammar Syntax:
 *
 *   * `filter = "tag=" tag | "tag_function=" function`
 *
 *   * `tag = string`
 *
 *   * `function = "oldest_tag()"`
 *
 *   The `oldest_tag()` function returns tasks which have the same tag as the
 *   oldest task (ordered by schedule time).
 *
 *   SDK compatibility: Although the SDK allows tags to be either
 *   string or
 *   [bytes](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/java/javadoc/com/google/appengine/api/taskqueue/TaskOptions.html#tag-byte:A-),
